1
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,250
 The host is holding a massive golden

2
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,383
 microphone that is too heavy to carry.

3
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:09,433
 People so close to me are struggling

4
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:12,800
 right now and yet I'm talking about the

5
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,183
 engineering concepts of

6
01:00:14,183 --> 01:00:16,750
 building 240 workflows.

7
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,183
 I'm just scaring people off.

8
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:20,666
 Last week, I made a decision.

9
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,233
 I'm going to pivot, building tools with

10
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,750
 no code and no technical background.

11
01:00:26,116 --> 01:00:28,983
 So you can become a delivery pilot and

12
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:29,900
 make sure you are

13
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,083
 transforming in the AIH.

14
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:34,516
 Everybody will get their jet pack on and

15
01:00:34,516 --> 01:00:35,800
 they are gonna look ahead.

16
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,750
 I'm talking with someone, a friend of

17
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,916
 mine who escaped from the war.

18
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:43,800
 Think about this like a giant glass that

19
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,599
 she's outside and there's no code tools

20
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:48,150
 for her to survive

21
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,250
 this billion dollar war.

22
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,650
 I'm unlikely to get this golden

23
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,866
 microphone anyway from the engineers in

24
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:57,766
 the enterprises that I work for.

25
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:01,000
 They are moving like zombie snails in a

26
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,183
 10 year race to be able to get there for

27
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:05,433
 the AI transformation.

28
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,083
 There's a massive

29
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:10,116
 resistance, but we are closing the gap.

30
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,983
 I want everybody to be able to use the

31
01:01:12,983 --> 01:01:16,050
 simulations, do their checklist, clone

32
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,683
 the repos, fork them and create their

33
01:01:18,683 --> 01:01:21,033
 bespoke applications using the AI.

34
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:22,116
 The scene, the statue

35
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:23,816
 hall, the screen capture,

36
01:01:24,383 --> 01:01:25,550
 static rules.

37
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,766
 A visual, a row of a frozen statues,

38
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:31,550
 static versus a character

39
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,800
 made out of liquid mercury,

40
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,816
 changing shapes like the terminator.

41
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:36,616
 It's dynamic.

42
01:01:36,733 --> 01:01:38,833
 The static rules are easily broken.

43
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:40,699
 If you look at these rules you are going

44
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:43,183
 to see that they are hard-coded, rigid

45
01:01:43,183 --> 01:01:45,633
 and can easily break at day

46
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:47,250
 one when the things change.

47
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:50,733
 dynamic rules is like liquid mercury

48
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:53,183
 rather than stone statues.

49
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:56,633
 This is our key in the age of AI, I

50
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,849
 expect everybody to be able to create

51
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:00,016
 their own applications.

52
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,849
 We build these bespoke apps using

53
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:05,949
 anti-gravity, using cloth so everybody

54
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:07,816
 can scout their own reality.

55
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,400
 You are not just bonded with

56
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,766
 the schools, the old system.

57
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,816
 We want the power that becomes our heavy

58
01:02:13,816 --> 01:02:16,933
 iron chain that is difficult to escape,

59
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:19,849
 the school system, the things that we

60
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:20,866
 learned in the past.

61
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,216
 They are right now obsolete.

62
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:24,316
 We are going to break our chains and we

63
01:02:24,316 --> 01:02:26,599
 will be able to build our own solutions.

64
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:29,283
 The scene, the clone lab, the screen

65
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:31,616
 capture, terminal git clone demo.


66
01:02:34,949 --> 01:02:37,433
 So getting GitHub repositories to your

67
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:40,283
 local powerhouse is the key for us to be

68
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:42,316
 able to run these agents.

69
01:02:42,316 --> 01:02:44,566
 What we are going to do it is the magic

70
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,066
 of the delivery pilot

71
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,566
 template is the key.

72
01:02:47,566 --> 01:02:49,900
 First of all, we are going to clone that

73
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,233
 repository to an empty folder.

74
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,783
 Once we have the clone repository, we are

75
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:57,166
 going to use the agent to be able to

76
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,300
 execute the commands.

77
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,699
 Then we are going to have

78
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:01,216
 the tooling system for us.

79
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,400
 We are going to see we could either use a

80
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,016
 standard tool or we could

81
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,849
 definitely use other tools for us.

82
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:10,800
 The standard tool is the free tier.

83
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,550
 If you don't want to spend any money, you

84
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,233
 are going to use the free tier.

85
01:03:15,233 --> 01:03:16,500
 The next is the tooling.

86
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,599
 If you don't want to use any money, use

87
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:21,616
 the standard kit and you will be able to

88
01:03:21,616 --> 01:03:22,566
 use the Visual Studio

89
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,033
 and the GitHub for free.

90
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,966
 This is the way to go for the starters.

91
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:29,650
 Then if you want to have a pair pilot,

92
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:31,633
 you can definitely use the GitHub

93
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:34,150
 co-pilot to be able to do your job.

94
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:36,349
 But if you want something on your local

95
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:39,233
 that is going to run with the agents on

96
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,750
 your local, then using something like a

97
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,466
 cursor AI makes more sense.

98
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:45,716
 Think about this like an evolution.

99
01:03:46,183 --> 01:03:48,933
 I use three of them and I will be able to

100
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:50,233
 swap between each other.

101
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,750
 The visual, a machine that is 3D printing

102
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,416
 in an identical copy of the host.

103
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,766
 The foundation is the

104
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,316
 reusable delivery pilot.

105
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,949
 I'm creating the repositories, I'm

106
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:03,650
 cloning myself and you learn how to clone

107
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,849
 yourself in the future.

108
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,866
 By being able to learn how to clone

109
01:04:07,866 --> 01:04:09,449
 yourself, you are going to

110
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:11,000
 move between the AI providers.

111
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:14,349
 I will show you how to glue this in a

112
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:17,133
 free environment and also show this how

113
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:19,449
 to be able to do this with the agents.

114
01:04:20,066 --> 01:04:22,733
 This is like the giant floating islands.

115
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,349
 You are going to be able to

116
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:26,416
 move from one to the other.

117
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:29,033
 So you are going to learn how to operate

118
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:31,666
 it on your local and how to operate in an

119
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:32,933
 enterprise environment

120
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:34,949
 when it is time for the

121
01:04:36,066 --> 01:04:37,683
 and the internet kill switch.

122
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:39,866
 This is the master part that we are going

123
01:04:39,866 --> 01:04:43,416
 to be able to deploy our website by

124
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,383
 understanding the GitHub actions.

125
01:04:45,566 --> 01:04:48,016
 good part of the GitHub actions is every

126
01:04:48,016 --> 01:04:50,150
 change that we do, we will be able to

127
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,183
 deploy this using a CI

128
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:53,400
 CD pipeline as a web page.

129
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:57,250
 And we will be able to see the live

130
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,449
 execution type and the

131
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:01,250
 live website in our system.

132
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,216
 So we can see all of our

133
01:05:03,216 --> 01:05:05,400
 changes at once very easily.

134
01:05:05,866 --> 01:05:08,800
 We have two thousand three minutes, that

135
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,416
 is the key for us, that we can deploy

136
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:13,150
 these minutes to web pages.

137
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,833
 If you go to an enterprise, you are going

138
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,866
 to see that there will be self runners

139
01:05:17,866 --> 01:05:19,300
 happening in the

140
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,099
 background that is going to work

141
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:24,416
 Or you can go to alternatives and buy the

142
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:27,183
 enterprise solutions to be able to deploy

143
01:05:27,183 --> 01:05:28,616
 with optimized speed.

144
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:31,016
 Because this is going to be slow but

145
01:05:31,016 --> 01:05:32,233
 useful for you to be

146
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:33,483
 able to do your changes.

147
01:05:34,066 --> 01:05:36,316
 You can go to the enterprise, get GitHub

148
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:39,083
 co-pilot and get more minutes.

149
01:05:39,566 --> 01:05:42,016
 Or you can get your own bugs to be able

150
01:05:42,016 --> 01:05:43,483
 to do everything yourself.

151
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:45,166
 So this is going to give

152
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,416
 you much more flexibility.

153
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,383
 But always start from the GitHub actions.

154
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:50,300
 transformation.

155
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,416
 The scene, the nursery host arrow.

156
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,566
 A visual, a giant GitHub logo

157
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:57,066
 acting as a baby's nightlight.

158
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:59,666
 If you are a mom or a dad putting kids to

159
01:05:59,666 --> 01:06:00,683
 bed, like myself,

160
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,500
 consistency is your magic shield.

161
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,383
 Today, we are going to build something

162
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:06,949
 that I'm using in my flat.

163
01:06:07,383 --> 01:06:09,699
 This workflow is a giant red

164
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,133
 off lever for the internet.

165
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:14,416
 It lives and breathes inside GitHub.

166
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:16,033
 It turns the internet

167
01:06:16,033 --> 01:06:17,849
 on and off in the flat.

168
01:06:18,366 --> 01:06:20,283
 We are going to add special features,

169
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,883
 bespoke features for us to be able to

170
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:25,883
 turn only one kid's internet, turn the

171
01:06:25,883 --> 01:06:27,316
 other kid's internet on.

172
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,750
 So we might start a fight,

173
01:06:29,033 --> 01:06:30,633
 but we know what we are doing.

174
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:32,733
 We are going to give this to the mom so

175
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:34,816
 the mom can do the

176
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:36,316
 updates that she wants.

177
01:06:36,316 --> 01:06:38,366
 The screen capture, Google MSFT.

178
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:41,449
 A visual, a Google and a Microsoft logo

179
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:44,550
 colored head and holding an Alexa speaker

180
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,133
 like a crystal ball.

181
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:48,349
 I saw a colleague from my Microsoft days.

182
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,866
 He mentioned, "Why don't you use a Google

183
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:53,000
 skills or Alexa skills?

184
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:54,066
 They will always

185
01:06:54,066 --> 01:06:55,050
 speak in the background."

186
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,966
 These are the skills that you are going

187
01:06:56,966 --> 01:06:59,183
 to find out in your own use cases.

188
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,533
 The delivery pilot

189
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:02,150
 framework, the simulations

190
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,650
 and the

191
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:04,750
 If you try to come up with the solutions

192
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,866
 yourself, such as using the Google Play,

193
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:09,599
 you are going to see that this is going

194
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,316
 to be a walled garden for you, which

195
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:15,000
 means you are going to be locked in to

196
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,150
 the system while you

197
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,316
 are trying to use it.

198
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,300
 There's all these skills that is already

199
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,916
 designed and you are going

200
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:23,333
 to have the privacy text.

201
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:25,066
 You are going to share

202
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:26,366
 your data to the Google.

203
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:30,449
 Learning tools like Ozur is going to

204
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:32,566
 bring you overhead because you have to

205
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:35,916
 learn tools like Ozur and there's going

206
01:07:35,916 --> 01:07:37,916
 to be lots of points that you have to

207
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:40,250
 learn to be able to run it and it might

208
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,733
 not be very straight forward

209
01:07:41,733 --> 01:07:43,150
 in your home lab environment.

210
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,716
 And you are going to go through all these

211
01:07:45,716 --> 01:07:46,966
 constraints and the

212
01:07:46,966 --> 01:07:48,500
 costs and the friction

213
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,183
 of your waste.

214
01:07:49,616 --> 01:07:51,383
 You are going to see that there is lots

215
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:53,616
 of hardware that's going to get not used

216
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:56,666
 and you want to have a privacy and you

217
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:59,300
 want to be able to use something that you

218
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,050
 own instead of you are renting it from

219
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,883
 somebody else and you are going to have

220
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:05,866
 an infinite control on the

221
01:08:05,866 --> 01:08:07,216
 structure that you created.

222
01:08:12,316 --> 01:08:13,983
 delivery structure is

223
01:08:13,983 --> 01:08:16,083
 for you to figure out.

224
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,533
 I'm creating the structure.

225
01:08:18,183 --> 01:08:20,183
 I'm showing you how I am doing it.

226
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:22,816
 Your responsibility is take the delivery

227
01:08:22,816 --> 01:08:25,183
 pilot and go wherever you wanna go.

228
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:26,550
 The scene, the engine room,

229
01:08:26,933 --> 01:08:28,750
 the host aero, the visual.

230
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,649
 Host is standing in front of a clock

231
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:31,866
 where the hands are

232
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:33,766
 spinning at 1000X speed.

233
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:36,550
 We are triggering an AI transformation or

234
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:39,733
 hands-on experience by building our own

235
01:08:39,733 --> 01:08:41,033
 solutions using the

236
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,133
 artificial intelligence.

237
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:43,800
 We are in an ever

238
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,350
 spinning engine of learning.

239
01:08:45,616 --> 01:08:46,866
 I started with the books.

240
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,333
 I read the basic.

241
01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:50,016
 Right now we have the

242
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:51,949
 smartest operators in the room.

243
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,850
 All the books, all the videos are inside

244
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,833
 the AI agents waiting for you to be able

245
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,233
 to be turn your

246
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:01,666
 creativity into something gold.

247
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,966
 The scene, the kitchen table, the screen

248
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:06,466
 capture and the home network dashboard.

249
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:08,683
 The AI learning frontier, we are going to

250
01:09:08,683 --> 01:09:11,433
 use all these large language models to

251
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:12,933
 knowledge acquisition.

252
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:15,733
 We are going to use the quote "Capture,

253
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,350
 organize, distill and express framework"

254
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:21,983
 and all the data will come as a capture

255
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:23,733
 for you while we are learning.

256
01:09:24,283 --> 01:09:26,583
 So, you are going to see Claude solves

257
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:27,666
 most of the problems.

258
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,433
 Then there is the chat GPT.

259
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:31,750
 You can easily say why chat GPT is not

260
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,166
 the first because Claude's models are

261
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:35,666
 very very focused on it.

262
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:37,149
 Then my favorite, the

263
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:38,466
 free one, the deep seek.

264
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:40,766
 Any time that you need a large language

265
01:09:40,766 --> 01:09:42,750
 model you know that it is there and it

266
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,383
 has lots of potential and if you want

267
01:09:45,383 --> 01:09:48,000
 something versatile like the Gemini that

268
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,500
 you can use nano banana to create images

269
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,500
 you can do slides plus you can do the

270
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,633
 code as well on the Gemini

271
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:58,000
 and it is a big free tier as

272
01:09:58,316 --> 01:09:59,583
 Why the Claude is good?

273
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,533
 Why we need to use the Claude?

274
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,983
 Because the reasoning layer is top notch

275
01:10:03,983 --> 01:10:08,383
 with the Sonnet 3.5, right now 4.5 and

276
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:12,133
 4.6 we see that it is able to solve the

277
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:13,383
 most complex problems.

278
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:15,866
 As we mentioned chat GPT is versatile.

279
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:19,433
 It is the leading tool in the AI space.

280
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:21,116
 We will be able to use it.

281
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:23,916
 I mostly use it as a search engine for

282
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:25,250
 myself and you can do

283
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,833
 this by a Chrome extension.

284
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:29,066
 The deep seek is the coding disruptor.

285
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:30,666
 You are going to see that this free

286
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:33,316
 structure that is going to help you a lot

287
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:36,183
 and you should be able to copy paste this

288
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:39,449
 code outside of the editors which you

289
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:40,983
 want to use it for free.

290
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:43,583
 The last but not the least the Gemini is

291
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:46,233
 the versatile platform which integrates

292
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:48,766
 with all these tools and you will be able

293
01:10:48,766 --> 01:10:51,199
 to see the Google does not want to lose

294
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:52,899
 the search it will give you images.

295
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,899
 It is going to give you videos.

296
01:10:55,149 --> 01:10:57,016
 It is going to give you a coding editor

297
01:10:57,016 --> 01:10:58,500
 for them to be able to

298
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,933
 keep the search business.

299
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:01,949
 For you to be able to master the code in

300
01:11:01,949 --> 01:11:04,483
 seconds what you need to do it is you

301
01:11:04,483 --> 01:11:06,750
 need to be able to explain yourself in

302
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,616
 English very very easily.

303
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,616
 Understand the AI is generating it and

304
01:11:11,616 --> 01:11:13,816
 you need to learn how to debug this

305
01:11:13,816 --> 01:11:16,083
 yourself to be able to get better at

306
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,916
 So let's talk about the free tier.

307
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,683
 All of these free tiers have a use case.

308
01:11:22,116 --> 01:11:25,250
 I start with the chat GPT when it gets

309
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,916
 finished I will go to deep seek.

310
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:29,283
 If that doesn't work I will go to Gemini

311
01:11:29,283 --> 01:11:32,149
 and if I can't really solve something I

312
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:34,566
 might need to pay money for the cloud if

313
01:11:34,566 --> 01:11:36,750
 my free subscription is ending.

314
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,616
 Also don't forget all of these have

315
01:11:38,616 --> 01:11:40,983
 different skills and we are going to see

316
01:11:40,983 --> 01:11:43,116
 with those different skills coding

317
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:45,850
 reasoning creativity and ecosystem there

318
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:48,016
 are different use cases for different

319
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:49,816
 types of large language models.

320
01:11:49,816 --> 01:11:51,500
 So what you need to do it is you need to

321
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,966
 make sure you focus on learning and you

322
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:56,666
 set a path for yourself by using all

323
01:11:56,666 --> 01:11:59,866
 these tools go to their website plus also

324
01:11:59,866 --> 01:12:01,166
 use their mobile app

325
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,500
 A visual, a kitchen table flowing with

326
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,600
 100 tablets like a

327
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,116
 digital food getting served.

328
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:09,500
 It's a feast.

329
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,383
 Why not turn YouTube into a hobby?

330
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:13,266
 This is a family oriented week.

331
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:15,449
 Instead of serving food,

332
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,050
 today we are serving tablets.

333
01:12:17,649 --> 01:12:20,449
 We are building these interfaces for our

334
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:23,333
 use cases to manage the access in our

335
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,766
 household, in your flat.

336
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:28,933
 So think of this as a digital gatekeeper

337
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:31,233
 and you are going to build it using

338
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:34,116
 cloth, using Gemini, using DeepSeek.

339
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:36,433
 You are going to be the one who is going

340
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:38,750
 to be in charge and you are going to have

341
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,699
 this pure creativity on your side.

342
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:42,383
 The scene, the power

343
01:12:42,383 --> 01:12:44,733
 station, the power screen capture.

344
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,783
 We have the router table.

345
01:12:46,883 --> 01:12:49,216
 A visual, a lightning bolt being caught

346
01:12:49,216 --> 01:12:50,966
 in a small glass bottle.

347
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,883
 If I flip the switch and track the

348
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:54,500
 lighting, I lose the

349
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,966
 target light instantly.

350
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:58,383
 So join me, learn the flow

351
01:12:58,383 --> 01:13:00,066
 with the speed of the waterfall

352
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:02,733
 and the clarity of the diamond.

353
01:13:02,733 --> 01:13:04,283
 This is your key moment.

354
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:07,033
 You are going to see that you will be

355
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:09,933
 able to capture everything that you do if

356
01:13:09,933 --> 01:13:12,866
 you get your hands on and turn this on.

357
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,616
 The scene, the tool shed screen, the

358
01:13:15,616 --> 01:13:18,716
 capture, the GitHub and the tool demo.

359
01:13:18,716 --> 01:13:22,699
 Visual, all visual toolbox where the

360
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,149
 tools are literally

361
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,616
 vibrating with energy.

362
01:13:25,616 --> 01:13:27,516
 Let's look at what I'm doing with the

363
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:29,083
 Internet Access Manager.

364
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,500
 I'm trying to create it with my delivery

365
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,283
 pilot framework, so I can have a

366
01:13:34,283 --> 01:13:36,966
 framework on top of the system that I'm

367
01:13:36,966 --> 01:13:38,833
 going to build, because this is going to

368
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,399
 be a bespoke solution for myself.

369
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:43,866
 If we look down to this, we are going to

370
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:46,583
 see that this is generated in an 8N, and

371
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,283
 I have all these different types of

372
01:13:48,283 --> 01:13:50,649
 triggers to be able to turn on the

373
01:13:50,649 --> 01:13:53,233
 Internet and turn off the Internet, and I

374
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:56,066
 have a logic that follows up and sends a

375
01:13:56,066 --> 01:13:58,449
 telegram message and then email at the

376
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,833
 end, so I know that the Internet is on.

377
01:14:01,066 --> 01:14:02,666
 This is my logic, this is

378
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:04,566
 my bespoke implementation.

379
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:07,416
 This is working behind my own system in

380
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:09,800
 the background where I ran

381
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,433
 an edge router in the back.

382
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:14,500
 Everybody will have a different router,

383
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,483
 so they are going to

384
01:14:15,483 --> 01:14:17,316
 program this in a different way.

385
01:14:17,316 --> 01:14:19,883
 main thing that I'm doing is I have the

386
01:14:19,883 --> 01:14:22,633
 MAC addresses, and I'm going to add a

387
01:14:22,633 --> 01:14:25,783
 drop rule on here to be able to drop the

388
01:14:25,783 --> 01:14:27,216
 traffic that I don't want

389
01:14:27,216 --> 01:14:29,183
 on here very, very easily.

390
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,216
 But you are going to realize I have all

391
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:33,866
 the MAC addresses mapped to all of the

392
01:14:33,866 --> 01:14:36,100
 devices in the flat, so it is very

393
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,633
 straightforward for me to be able to

394
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:40,316
 start or stop a

395
01:14:40,316 --> 01:14:41,683
 device getting the access.

396
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,533
 I have also created a user interface that

397
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:47,266
 I mentioned on GitHub using the GitHub

398
01:14:47,266 --> 01:14:50,083
 Pages feature and deploying this on here,

399
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:52,616
 which one of the features is adding

400
01:14:52,616 --> 01:14:54,399
 turning the Internet on, turning the

401
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:57,100
 Internet off, looking at the device list,

402
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,933
 because this is going to have the

403
01:14:58,933 --> 01:15:01,649
 firewall policies, and I have all the

404
01:15:01,649 --> 01:15:03,649
 implementation guide for myself.

405
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:06,750
 And this is for my wife to be able to use

406
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,033
 it, because I do not want to give my wife

407
01:15:09,033 --> 01:15:11,316
 a complex solution where she has got

408
01:15:11,316 --> 01:15:13,133
 issues turning on and

409
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:14,300
 turning off the Internet.

410
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,800
 Because this is an agentic system, as we

411
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,933
 see on here, we are going to see that

412
01:15:18,933 --> 01:15:21,649
 most of the time this works automatically

413
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:24,333
 in the background, and new rules are

414
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,000
 coming up all the time.

415
01:15:26,199 --> 01:15:27,566
 So the rules are dynamic,

416
01:15:27,866 --> 01:15:29,633
 I can always extend them.

417
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:31,949
 Because this is an agentic system as we

418
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:34,133
 see on here, we are going to see that

419
01:15:34,133 --> 01:15:36,800
 most of the time this works automatically

420
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,500
 in the background and new rules are

421
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,300
 coming up all the time.

422
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,216
 So the rules are

423
01:15:42,216 --> 01:15:44,333
 dynamic, I can always extend

424
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:45,833
 There's two critical

425
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,233
 places that I can look.

426
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:50,100
 First of all, I can go to my commits in

427
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,699
 the GitHub repository, which is private,

428
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:53,666
 and see how many

429
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:55,266
 times I change the system.

430
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:57,866
 As we see on here, this has been changed

431
01:15:57,866 --> 01:16:00,750
 more than 37 times, and I have different

432
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,449
 rules coming up on different times.

433
01:16:03,449 --> 01:16:04,683
 As I said, this is going

434
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:06,149
 to evolve all the time.

435
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:07,866
 This is a bespoke solution.

436
01:16:08,183 --> 01:16:11,050
 I will always change, update, and remove

437
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,233
 the existing features.

438
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,449
 While I'm adding new features, I will be

439
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:17,483
 able to see all my executions, and when

440
01:16:17,483 --> 01:16:19,199
 did it work, and when did it

441
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,050
 not work very, very easily.

442
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:22,600
 As I have seen on

443
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,250
 here, something happened.

444
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,216
 I have updated the code base.

445
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:27,616
 For the last couple of

446
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,050
 days, it is not working.

447
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,233
 Normally, it was working.

448
01:16:30,766 --> 01:16:33,000
 I should be able to go down into this

449
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,716
 system, and be able to see that it was

450
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,216
 working in the past very easily.

451
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:40,583
 I should be able to scroll down and see

452
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,483
 this was working on here.

453
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:43,316
 I deployed something

454
01:16:43,316 --> 01:16:45,600
 and broke the system down.

455
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,133
 So I will be able to see how many times

456
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:50,933
 this has worked in the past, and what did

457
01:16:50,933 --> 01:16:52,483
 I need to do to be able to

458
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,800
 make this work easier for myself.

459
01:16:55,149 --> 01:16:57,250
 There are all these different use cases

460
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,416
 on here that I can add

461
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:01,033
 definitely onto the system.

462
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,833
 This is going to make my life much easier

463
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:06,649
 to be able to manage this system, such as

464
01:17:06,649 --> 01:17:09,816
 I added a device control on here to be

465
01:17:09,816 --> 01:17:11,233
 able to turn on and

466
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:13,000
 off a specific device.

467
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,366
 That's a new feature that I'm trying to

468
01:17:15,366 --> 01:17:16,300
 add, but I have broken

469
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,750
 other parts of the system.

470
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,550
 I need to make sure I'm always looking at

471
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,250
 it and learning through this process.

472
01:17:22,766 --> 01:17:24,533
 The main thing that you can do, I have

473
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:26,666
 shared this in other videos, you can

474
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:29,133
 definitely come into here and set an

475
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:32,100
 error workflow to make sure that if one

476
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,716
 of your workflows is failing, you will be

477
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,199
 able to get a direct message.

478
01:17:36,316 --> 01:17:37,433
 Here is my niche update.

479
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:39,216
 I'm using the memory palaces.

480
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:41,316
 Let's transform all together.

481
01:17:41,883 --> 01:17:42,850
 Grab your hammer.

482
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,833
 That is the gate that is

483
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:47,033
 vibrating and your compass.

484
01:17:47,033 --> 01:17:48,866
 It could be your programmable router.

485
01:17:49,216 --> 01:17:50,266
 In my case, it is.

486
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:51,899
 I'm using the NA10.

487
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:53,250
 I'm using my compute.

488
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:55,600
 In your case, it could be your laptop.

489
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:58,033
 Find the things that is your own

490
01:17:58,033 --> 01:17:59,449
 environment in the

491
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:00,816
 delivery pilot structure.

492
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:03,000
 Build your bespoke solutions.

493
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,800
 Apps, what you love.

494
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,050
 Do what you wanna do.

495
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,483
 Focus on learning.

496
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:10,516
 Focus on self-learning for

497
01:18:10,516 --> 01:18:12,149
 yourself, for your family.

498
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:14,316
 Let's look at the tool shed, a complete

499
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:17,116
 GitHub Toolbox for modern developers.

500
01:18:17,216 --> 01:18:19,633
 The repository anatomy, mastering the

501
01:18:19,633 --> 01:18:21,483
 structure of the professional base.

502
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,133
 Once I do the delivery pilot, I always

503
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,350
 start with the reel

504
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,016
 and end with the testing.

505
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,500
 And there's all these

506
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,783
 stages come in the middle.

507
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:33,316
 The structure to have an organized system

508
01:18:33,316 --> 01:18:35,800
 is important to create a modular system

509
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,316
 where you can track your assets and you

510
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:40,816
 can separate your configuration and be

511
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:45,199
 able to do an X times N, meaning loss of

512
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,800
 repositories with the

513
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,666
 least amount of effort.

514
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:50,216
 While you are going to work on the

515
01:18:50,216 --> 01:18:51,783
 repost, the main thing that you are going

516
01:18:51,783 --> 01:18:54,933
 to get through is your ability to be able

517
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:57,166
 to write everything in a readme file.

518
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:00,183
 So this is the markdown format and you

519
01:19:00,183 --> 01:19:02,366
 are going to have always an operational

520
01:19:02,366 --> 01:19:05,083
 procedure for yourself how to use the

521
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:07,783
 repository in a hierarchical manner so

522
01:19:07,783 --> 01:19:09,383
 you can read and then

523
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:10,816
 study your environment.

524
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:14,083
 issues tab and the pull requests are the

525
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,100
 critical parts on GitHub where you are

526
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,000
 going to work on one project, you are

527
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,800
 going to see there is lots of issues

528
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,833
 coming up and things that are changing

529
01:19:22,983 --> 01:19:25,600
 and you have to be able to merge your

530
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,433
 branches to make sure that you have one

531
01:19:28,433 --> 01:19:31,399
 trunk that is always green and make sure

532
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,100
 that you are always doing

533
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,416
 the continuous integration.

534
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:35,050
 The collaboration

535
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,616
 function is the fork mechanism.

536
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,316
 Once you fork a repository what is

537
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:42,133
 happening is you are getting all the code

538
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:44,149
 pieces and you see all the

539
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:46,050
 history coming up in the project.

540
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:49,149
 You will be upstream syncing and you will

541
01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:50,933
 be able to open to contributions.

542
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:52,850
 You are going to create your

543
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,833
 own version of the program.

544
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,966
 If you look at the development cycle, you

545
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:59,050
 first clone the repo, you start

546
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:01,416
 customizing it, then you want to get

547
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:03,233
 certified, you want to be able to deploy,

548
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:04,566
 you want to be able to

549
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:06,383
 create your own program.

550
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:07,783
 Let's look at what is free.

551
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,983
 The GitHub part is completely free.

552
01:20:10,566 --> 01:20:12,649
 Downloading Visual Studio is free, having

553
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:15,383
 a git repository is free and if you want

554
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:17,683
 to run environments, different programs,

555
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:20,283
 the docker is free for you.

556
01:20:20,366 --> 01:20:21,850
 The main start is you

557
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,216
 start always with zero capital.

558
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:26,800
 Once you start with zero capital, you

559
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,583
 don't have monthly investment on the

560
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,883
 system, you are mostly putting the money

561
01:20:30,883 --> 01:20:32,283
 into your journey

562
01:20:32,283 --> 01:20:34,399
 which you need to focus on.

563
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:37,449
 If we compare the free versions, you get

564
01:20:37,449 --> 01:20:39,116
 all the Visual Studio plugins.

565
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:42,500
 Once you go to paid IDs such as the

566
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,883
 JetBrains or use a GitHub co-pilot, you

567
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:47,050
 are going to spend more

568
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,783
 money to be able to do more.

569
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,283
 So these are going to come in once you

570
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:53,949
 want to do more of the stuff and you want

571
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:56,983
 to have dedicated timelines on here and

572
01:20:56,983 --> 01:20:58,516
 advanced security features.

573
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:01,616
 But having private repos and being able

574
01:21:01,616 --> 01:21:04,366
 to build this on GitHub is always free.

575
01:21:24,433 --> 01:21:26,783
 The scene, the balcony, the host arrow.

576
01:21:26,783 --> 01:21:29,266
 Host looking out over the futuristic city

577
01:21:29,383 --> 01:21:30,516
 being built by the

578
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:32,783
 drones using the simulations.

579
01:21:32,783 --> 01:21:34,116
 Every simulation

580
01:21:34,116 --> 01:21:35,716
 starts with the assessment.

581
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,850
 Make sure that you take the assessment

582
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,399
 first, then go and watch

583
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,966
 the simulations video second.

584
01:21:41,216 --> 01:21:43,083
 Once you launch the assessment, you are

585
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,483
 going to see all your skills gaps at

586
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:48,166
 start, so you need to understand where

587
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,666
 you are gapping the issues.

588
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:52,333
 You watch the video on the top and at the

589
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:53,466
 bottom there's a checklist.

590
01:21:53,699 --> 01:21:55,850
 Make sure that you are checking network

591
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,250
 authentication profile resources.

592
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:00,516
 With every video you are going to get a

593
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:01,416
 different checklist.

594
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,949
 So this is vital for you to make sure

595
01:22:03,949 --> 01:22:05,883
 that you are able to sync

596
01:22:05,883 --> 01:22:07,616
 up with what is in the video.

597
01:22:07,633 --> 01:22:09,516
 Once you complete your simulation

598
01:22:09,516 --> 01:22:12,066
 running, meaning you are going to have a

599
01:22:12,066 --> 01:22:14,750
 program that runs in the background, that

600
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,100
 is the clone of this

601
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,666
 application that you can turn it on.

602
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:20,050
 This is the vital stage

603
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:21,916
 for you to be able to turn

604
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,899
 Once you are able to do this, you are

605
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:25,866
 going to see that you will run this in

606
01:22:25,883 --> 01:22:28,416
 different amounts on Windows, iOS,

607
01:22:28,716 --> 01:22:30,600
 Android, on code spaces.

608
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,433
 Different environments

609
01:22:31,433 --> 01:22:33,233
 is very, very important.

610
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:36,250
 And you are going to soon realize this is

611
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,250
 not only one device that you are going to

612
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,516
 run, you are going to run a mesh of

613
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:42,216
 devices and they are going to get

614
01:22:42,216 --> 01:22:43,516
 connected to each other.

615
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:45,533
 The dashboards are very critical.

616
01:22:45,783 --> 01:22:48,000
 I always encourage you to be able to

617
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,633
 deploy a website and make sure that you

618
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:53,683
 are doing it with the GitHub actions and

619
01:22:53,883 --> 01:22:55,783
 iterate on this all the time.

620
01:22:56,033 --> 01:22:58,449
 So this is going to give you the real

621
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:00,966
 feeling of what you really need to

622
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:04,116
 Such as in my case, the kids devices and

623
01:23:04,116 --> 01:23:06,666
 I'm responding to their controls and this

624
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:09,566
 process is always going to change because

625
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:10,949
 I have kids, they are at

626
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:13,199
 three years old to nine years old.

627
01:23:13,616 --> 01:23:15,949
 The use cases for three years old is very

628
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,033
 different than the use

629
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:18,366
 cases in nine year old.

630
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:21,383
 So I need to make sure I play the game by

631
01:23:21,383 --> 01:23:23,883
 their rules and understand what are my

632
01:23:23,883 --> 01:23:25,666
 requirements and what are my changes.

633
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:28,399
 Looking at the logs, the event streams on

634
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:31,633
 the GitHub or the NA10 is very critical

635
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:33,716
 for you to understand the automatic

636
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:36,649
 triggers and the audit trail is very,

637
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:38,433
 very important because at the end of

638
01:23:38,433 --> 01:23:40,300
 today, you want to have a secure

639
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,933
 environment doing this and working like a

640
01:23:42,933 --> 01:23:45,483
 clock for you is very, very critical.

641
01:23:45,483 --> 01:23:47,350
 What will be your success metrics?

642
01:23:47,616 --> 01:23:48,816
 You want to make sure that you are

643
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:51,366
 compliant, you have lots of accuracy.

644
01:23:51,666 --> 01:23:52,466
 In the beginning, you

645
01:23:52,466 --> 01:23:53,899
 might not start very current.

646
01:23:54,433 --> 01:23:55,850
 In the beginning, you might have more

647
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:57,883
 latency because you are using free tools.

648
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:00,466
 And at the end of today, you want to have

649
01:24:00,466 --> 01:24:03,033
 make sure you are learning through this

650
01:24:03,033 --> 01:24:04,183
 process, which is the

651
01:24:04,183 --> 01:24:05,550
 key for your self growth.

652
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:07,166
 Building your own, that is

653
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,933
 the maximum that you can go.

654
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:12,750
 To become a delivery pilot, what we want

655
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,050
 you is, we want you to be able to come

656
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,800
 out of this simulation and

657
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,649
 build your own local environment.

658
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:22,116
 So we start with cloning the repo first,

659
01:24:22,116 --> 01:24:23,916
 then starting configuring.

660
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:26,983
 Make sure after you configure, you create

661
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:27,949
 your own environment.

662
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:30,366
 I have built these simulations for you.

663
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,466
 Build the future with me.

664
01:24:32,683 --> 01:24:33,616
 Till next time.

665
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,449
 Love.

666
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:35,399
 Bye-bye, bye-bye.
