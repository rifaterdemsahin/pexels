## Video Script: The Delivery Pilot Transformation

**[Scene 1: The Heavy Mic]**


**Host:** I’m standing here holding a massive golden microphone that is honestly too heavy to carry. It’s a symbol of the engineering "elites" in enterprises who move like zombie snails in a ten-year race toward AI transformation. I’m unlikely to get that microphone from them anyway.

**[Scene 2: The Pivot]**


**Host:** Last week, I made a decision. I realized that while I’m talking about complex engineering concepts for 240 workflows, people close to me are struggling. I’m just scaring people off. I am pivoting to building tools with no code and no technical background so you can become a "delivery pilot" in the AI age.

**[Scene 3: Statues vs. Mercury]**


**Host:** Look at this hall of frozen, stone statues. These represent hard-coded, rigid rules that break the moment things change. Compare that to a character made of liquid mercury, shifting shapes like the Terminator. That is the difference between static systems and the dynamic rules of AI. We are breaking the iron chains of the old school system; those old lessons are obsolete.

**[Scene 4: The Local Powerhouse]**


**Host (Screen Capture - Terminal):** It starts in the Clone Lab. Getting GitHub repositories to your local powerhouse is the key to running agents. First, we clone the delivery pilot template to an empty folder. Once you have that repository, you use the agent to execute commands and build your tooling system.

**[Scene 5: The Free Tier Journey]**


**Host:** You can start with zero capital. Use the standard kit—Visual Studio and GitHub—for free. If you want a "pair pilot," use GitHub Co-pilot. If you want something local and agentic, Cursor AI makes more sense. Think of it like an evolution; I swap between all three.

**[Scene 6: The Internet Kill Switch]**


**Host (Visual: GitHub Nightlight):** If you’re a parent putting kids to bed, consistency is your magic shield. I’ve built a workflow in my flat that acts as a giant red off-lever for the internet. It lives inside GitHub and allows me to turn one kid’s internet off while keeping the other’s on. It might start a fight, but we know what we’re doing.

**[Scene 7: The LLM Feast]**


**Host (Visual: Kitchen table with 100 tablets):** We are serving a digital feast today. You have a choice of models:

* 
**Claude**: The reasoning layer is top-notch with Sonnet 3.5, 4.5, and 4.6 for complex problems.


* **ChatGPT**: The versatile leader; I use it mostly as a search engine.


* 
**DeepSeek**: The coding disruptor—it’s a powerful free alternative.


* 
**Gemini**: The versatile platform that handles images via "Nano Banana," slides, and code all in one free tier.



**[Scene 8: The Bespoke Logic]**


**Host (Screen Capture - n8n):** This is my bespoke implementation. It uses n8n to trigger logic that drops traffic based on specific MAC addresses. I created a user interface on GitHub Pages so my wife can easily manage it without facing a complex system.

**[Scene 9: The Success Metrics]**


**Host:** You will break things—I’ve broken my own system 37 times while adding features. But because we use GitHub Actions, every change is a CI/CD pipeline deployment. You can see your live execution and your audit trail. Your success metrics are compliance, accuracy, and, ultimately, self-growth.

**[Scene 10: Conclusion]**


**Host (Visual: Balcony overlooking drone city):** Every simulation starts with an assessment. Take the assessment, identify your gaps, and then watch the simulation. Clone the repo, configure your environment, and build the future with me. Till next time. Love. Bye-bye.
