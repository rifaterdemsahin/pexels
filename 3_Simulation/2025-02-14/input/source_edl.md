## 2. Script: "The Delivery Pilot Transformation"

**Hook:** I'm likely to never get this golden microphone from enterprise engineers—they move like zombie snails in a 10-year race. But right now, people close to me are struggling, and I’m scaring them off with complex engineering concepts.

**The Core Message:** Last week, I made a decision: I’m pivoting to building tools with no code and no technical background. You don’t need to be bonded to the old system—those iron chains are obsolete.

**Technical Breakdown:**

* 
**The Foundation:** Start by cloning the "Delivery Pilot" repository to a local powerhouse.


* 
**The Tooling:** Use the free tier (Visual Studio and GitHub) or level up to Cursor AI for local agentic workflows.


* 
**The Deployment:** Every change you make is deployed via GitHub Actions and a CI/CD pipeline as a live web page.



**Practical Application:** I use this in my own flat. I've built a "Giant Red Off Lever" for the internet that lives in GitHub. It lets me (and my wife) manage specific internet access for our kids through a bespoke dashboard.

**Conclusion:** Don't just watch the simulations; take the assessment, find your skill gaps, and build your own local environment. Build what you love.
